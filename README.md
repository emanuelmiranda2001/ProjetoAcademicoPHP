## This project was done in "Desenvolvimento de Aplicações WEB II" at the "Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro"

In this project I use the laravel framework with PHP. This was the first project where I used object-oriented programming. I made an online store with all the necessary functionality.

In this project I:
<br>&emsp;- set up a database;
<br>&emsp;- made an authentication system using the laravel ui;
<br>&emsp;- configured the email service;
<br>&emsp;- made the ACL settings (Spatie - Permission);

<br>&emsp;- made a search system with autocomplete;
<br>&emsp;- made a ticket system;
<br>&emsp;- created a shopping cart;
